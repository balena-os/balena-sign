        And it is only provided for x86_64 architectures, so the signing server

        EFI variables can be either flagged as appends or replacements.
        A replacement is always time-authenticated, which in our use-case
        breaks rollbacks. Appending bypasses the time protection and gives
        us better control in HUP scripts.

    - subject: Allow signing external ESL at db level
      hash: 5f37a8b8d1845d312e7df5ad5ad929c4c8255eb9
      body: |
        We are moving to authenticating the bootable images by hashes
        of the EFI binaries instead of an embedded signature. This way the ESL
        with the hashes is built by the client (yocto) and sent to sign
        as is. This patch extends the secureboot/db signing API to allow
        sending an external ESL instead of cert_id.

        This only applies to db, PK and KEK are still certificates.

        This is the minimum required by the UEFI spec, anything more causes

        in some UEFI implementations.


        While this is technically a regression (going down from SHA512 to
        SHA256),

        we expect a separate PR to expose this in the API and make SHA512
        available

        if requested.
